# Kandji Self Service

Scripts that I put in Self Service for users to run as needed.

## Scripts Overview

### `dockPicker.py`
When run from Self Service, the script scans the /Applications folder to generate a list of non-Apple apps and presents them to the user as a selection list. The user can choose the apps they want to add to their dock by checking the corresponding boxes.

There is also an option to completely clear the dock before adding any apps or to clear the dock without adding any apps.
