# Kandji Scripts

Scripts in this directory interact with the Kandji MDM API. They are divided into subfolders based on how they are used.

## Subdirectories

- `Daily Checks/` – Automated reporting scripts.
- `Self Service/` – User focused utilities that can be added to Kandji Self Service.
- `Secrets/` – Helper for managing API keys in the macOS keychain.

All scripts rely on the environment variables listed in the repository root README.
