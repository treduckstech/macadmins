# Kandji Daily Checks

Python scripts that I run daily to check on the status of devices in Kandji. I use GitHub actions to run these scripts but they could easily be run from a local machine or a VM. The output is sent to a Slack channel so I have a consise summary of all of my macOS devices. Github Secrets are used to store API keys and URLs.
